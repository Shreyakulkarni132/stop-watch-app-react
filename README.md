# Stopwatch App made in React

A simple and responsive stopwatch app built with **React**, utilizing **useState**, **useRef**, and **useEffect** hooks for state management, side effects, and referencing DOM elements. The app allows users to start, stop, and reset the stopwatch, and it keeps track of the elapsed time.

## Features

- **Start/Stop Timer**: Start and stop the stopwatch at any time.
- **Reset Timer**: Reset the stopwatch back to zero.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across devices, including desktops and mobile devices.
- **Efficient State Management**: Uses React's **useState** for managing the timer state and **useRef** for accessing DOM elements without re-rendering.
